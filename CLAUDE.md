# IDA — Internally Developed Apps

## What It Is

An orchestration, availability, and governance framework that enables people to develop their own apps in an enterprise and submit them to a catalogue. The catalogue publishes approved apps to all users using the concept of **contracts**.

## Three Pillars

- **Orchestration** — Manages app lifecycle (development, submission, review, publishing, retirement)
- **Availability** — Catalogue-based discovery and access for all enterprise users
- **Governance** — Enforces standards and requirements through contracts

## Contracts

Contracts are unbreakable bonds that define what an app must do in order to be publishable. An app that violates its contract cannot be published.

**Example:** A web app that generates PowerPoint project status presentations. Its contract states:
- Read-only access to last month's presentation
- Honours enterprise access controls
- Scoped to only the projects the current user has access to
